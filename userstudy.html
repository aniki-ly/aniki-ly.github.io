    <h1>User Study on Text-to-Video Generation</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you very much for helping us with our research! In this survey, we will present text descriptions along with corresponding videos, which are generated by four state-of-the-art text-to-video AI models. Each question will include a text prompt and the corresponding generated videos. Your task is to rank its performance across different dimensions. Additionally, please provide a final comprehensive ranking based on your preferences.</p>
    <p>This survey consists of 5 questions and will approximately take 10 min of your time.</p>
